Description: This package imports the data relative the student's grade from the 
             course "Introduction to physics" and analyzes the scores.
             The average, the mean and median are computed to get a better sense of the
             data distribution.
             Finally an histogram is plotted, showing scores' frequencies, broken down
             by grades.
